**Note**

This is a Capstone Project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree from Udacity.

The requirements to run this project are the same of the dog-project's:

https://github.com/udacity/dog-project

Please refer to the link above to set the correct environment to run this code.

All project coding is written on the files:

* Cachipun.ipynb
* mmtc_misc_tools.py

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from the following link (temporarily):

https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mtcapps/mlcapstone/datasets.zip

For now, this dataset is only intended to be used for this project and its evaluation. Please write me if you want to use it with other purposes.

The train, test and validation directories must be unzipped into a folder called *datasets* in the project's main folder.
